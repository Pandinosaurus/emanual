- Raw Message Definition

  ```py
  # This message holds a collection of N-dimensional points, which may
  # contain additional information such as normals, intensity, etc. The
  # point data is stored as a binary blob, its layout described by the
  # contents of the "fields" array.

  # (unordered). Point clouds organized as 2d images may be produced by
  # camera depth sensors such as stereo or time-of-flight.
  # The point cloud data may be organized 2d (image-like) or 1d
  # Time of sensor data acquisition, and the coordinate frame ID (for 3d
  # points).
  Header header

  # 2D structure of the point cloud. If the cloud is unordered, height is
  # 1 and width is the length of the point cloud.
  uint32 height
  uint32 width

  # Describes the channels and their layout in the binary data blob.
  PointField[] fields

  bool    is_bigendian # Is this data bigendian?
  uint32  point_step   # Length of a point in bytes
  uint32  row_step     # Length of a row in bytes
  uint8[] data         # Actual point data, size is (row_step*height)

  bool is_dense        # True if there are no invalid points
